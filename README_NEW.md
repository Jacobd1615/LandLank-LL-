## OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

### User Verification Workflow

**Phase 1: Personal Identity Verification**
1. User provides personal identification information (name, government ID, date of birth)
2. System validates provided information against hashed database records
3. User submits live photograph for biometric verification
4. AI facial recognition compares live photo against stored reference hash

**Phase 2: Organizational Verification**
1. UN staff member provides organizational identification and photograph
2. System captures dual-person photograph (user + UN staff)
3. AI verification confirms both individuals present in organizational photo
4. Verification confidence scores recorded for audit and compliance purposes

**Phase 3: Token Distribution**
1. Successful dual verification triggers token balance display (hashed wallet ID)
2. Weekly redemption limits enforced based on program parameters
3. Geographic restrictions validated through kiosk location verification
4. Transaction recorded in audit trail with full compliance documentation

### Anti-Gaming Enforcement Protocols

**Geographic Violation Detection**
- Automated flagging of claims attempted outside designated program areas
- Real-time alerting to UN oversight personnel for immediate intervention
- Progressive enforcement scaling from warnings to program suspension

**Program Suspension Procedures**
- Automatic suspension triggered after 5+ geographic violations
- Immediate notification to UN coordination teams and government oversight
- Emergency token reallocation procedures initiated for continued aid delivery

**Public Pool Activation**
- Suspended program tokens transferred to area-restricted public pools
- Maintained verification requirements for public pool token claiming
- Geographic restrictions preserved to ensure appropriate beneficiary access
